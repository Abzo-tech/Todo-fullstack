# Frontend-Backend Adaptation Plan

## Analysis Summary

✅ **Backend Status**: All required endpoints are implemented and working
✅ **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for frontend port (5173)
✅ **Authentication System**: JWT-based auth is fully compatible
✅ **API Endpoints**: All frontend calls match backend routes

## Required Adaptations

### 1. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Update API_BASE_URL in frontend to match backend port (3000)
- [ ] Ensure frontend runs on port 5173 (default Vite port)
- [ ] Verify database connection and seeding

### 2. Data Structure Alignment
- [ ] Verify task object structure matches between frontend/backend
- [ ] Ensure user object structure is consistent
- [ ] Check image upload handling

### 3. Authentication Flow
- [ ] Test login/register endpoints
- [ ] Verify JWT token handling
- [ ] Test token validation on protected routes

### 4. Task Management Features
- [ ] Test CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Test task sharing functionality
- [ ] Test image upload functionality
- [ ] Test archive/unarchive functionality

### 5. Error Handling
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for API failures
- [ ] Add loading states for async operations
- [ ] Handle network connectivity issues

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Start backend server on port 3000
- [ ] Verify database connection
- [ ] Test all API endpoints manually

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Start frontend development server
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test task creation and management
- [ ] Test all advanced features (sharing, images, archiving)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test complete user workflow
- [ ] Verify real-time updates
- [ ] Test error scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **Start Backend**: Run the backend server
2. **Start Frontend**: Run the frontend development server
3. **Test Integration**: Verify the complete system works together
4. **Fix Issues**: Address any compatibility issues found
5. **Optimize**: Improve performance and user experience

## Notes

- Backend is running on port 3000
- Frontend should run on port 5173 (default)
- CORS is properly configured
- All API endpoints are implemented
- Authentication system is complete
